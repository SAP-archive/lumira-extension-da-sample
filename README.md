Sample Extension - SAP Lumira Version 2 Data Access Extension SDK
==========================================================
A data access extension is a plugin module that allows users to access an additional data source that is not supported out of the box in SAP Lumira. For example, using the SDK you can create data access extensions to import data from XML files, social data sources like Twitter or Facebook, or other databases like MongoDB.

This sample extension repo has code you’ll need to get started with creating your own data access extensions for Lumira 1.29 and above.

-----------------
* Open Extension Manager, `File > Extensions`
* Click `Manual Installation`
* Select the zip file from `\docs`
* Restart SAP Lumira Desktop
* Select `File > New Dataset`
* Select `SAP Lumira Sample Extension` from the list of connectors
* Enter the dataset name and these parameters
 + `CSV File`: File path of the CSV File in `docs\sample-data`
 + `Metadata File`: Metadata file describing the data columns being imported in `docs\sample-data`
* Select `OK` to import data into a new document
