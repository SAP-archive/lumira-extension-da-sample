8    1. Definitions. 
9 
10       "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

12 
13       "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by 
14       the copyright owner that is granting the License. 
15 
16       "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all 
17       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common 
18       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, 
19       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
20       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
21       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
22       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 
23 
24       "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity 
25       exercising permissions granted by this License. 
26 
27       "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, 
28       including but not limited to software source code, documentation 
29       source, and configuration files. 
30 
31       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
32       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but 
33       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
34       and conversions to other media types. 
35 
36       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
37       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
38       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
39       (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
40 
41       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
42       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
43       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
44       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
45       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
46       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
47       the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
48 
49       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
50       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
51       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
52       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner 
53       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
54       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
55       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
56       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
57       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, 
58       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
59       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
60       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
61       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 
62 
63       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
64       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
65       subsequently incorporated within the Work. 
66 
67    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
68       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
69       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
70       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
71       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
72       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 
73 
74    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
75       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
76       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
77       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
78       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
79       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
80       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
81       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
82       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
83       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
84       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
85       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
86       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
87       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
88       as of the date such litigation is filed. 
89 
90    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
91       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
92       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
93       meet the following conditions: 
94 
95       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
96           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 
97 
98       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
99           stating that You changed the files; and 
100 
101       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
102           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
103           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
104           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
105           the Derivative Works; and 
106 
107       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
108           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
109           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
110           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
111           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
112           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
113           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
114           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
115           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
116           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
117           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
118           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
119           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
120           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
121           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
122           as modifying the License. 
123 
124       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
125       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
126       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
127       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
128       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
129       the conditions stated in this License. 
130 
131    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
132       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
133       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
134       this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
135       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
136       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
137       with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
138 
139    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
140       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
141       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
142       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
143 
144    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
145       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
146       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
147       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
148       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
149       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
150       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
151       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
152       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
153 
154    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
155       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
156       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
157       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
158       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
159       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
160       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
161       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
162       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
163       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
164       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
165 
166    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
167       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
168       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
169       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
170       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
171       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
172       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
173       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
174       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
175       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
